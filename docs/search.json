    "text": "2 Relentless Excellence: Consistency, Winning, and Finishing at the Top\nIn professional golf, survival is hard enough. Making the cut each week is an achievement by itself. Winning? That’s something even the best players only manage a handful of times across years.\nTiger made it look effortless.\nFrom 1998 to 2005, Tiger Woods made 142 consecutive cuts — a PGA Tour record so absurd that no one else has even come close.\nDuring that same stretch, Tiger wasn’t just making weekends — he was winning nearly a quarter of the tournaments he entered.\nTo really appreciate how far ahead he was, we don’t just compare Tiger to the field — we compare him to the other greatest player in history: Jack Nicklaus. Even when we isolate Jack’s prime years (1962–1975), the years when he was at his absolute best, Tiger’s numbers still jump off the page as something unprecedented.\n Figure: Cut-making and win percentage across career.\nThe graph speaks for itself: Tiger’s combination of consistency and winning is practically unmatched. Most pros spend their careers grinding for a few good weeks; Tiger played to win — and more often than not, he delivered.\nAnd he didn’t just win. He lived at the top.\nThroughout his career, Tiger finished in the top 10 in more than half of his starts — and during his prime years, he was even more dominant. His top-5 and top-10 rates are so far above the rest of the field — and even above prime Nicklaus — that they almost break the graph.\n Figure: Top 5 and Top 10 finishes compared to PGA Tour players.\nOther great players cluster near the bottom — celebrating a few big moments across a career. Tiger existed in a different stratosphere."

    "text": "3 Career Earnings\nIf dominance ever needed a scoreboard, it would look a lot like Tiger Woods’ bank account.\nEven without adjusting for inflation and the overall growth of the PGA Tour, Tiger’s career earnings tower over everyone else’s. He’s the only player to surpass $120 million in official prize money — a total that dwarfs the next closest player, Rory McIlroy, by over $17 million.\n Figure: PGA Tour Career Earnings — Top 20 All-Time.\nAnd it’s not just about big purses. Tiger amassed the bulk of his winnings during an era when tournament payouts were smaller than they are today. He didn’t simply ride the wave of golf’s financial boom — he created it. Without Tiger, the money wouldn’t have been there.\nIn every measurable way — wins, finishes, earnings — Tiger Woods wasn’t just the best. He was a category of one."

    "text": "4 Rise and Reign in the Rankings\nThe World Golf Rankings tell the story of who’s good, who’s rising, and who’s falling. They’re built for chaos — with players climbing and dropping every few weeks based on form, injury, and luck.\nBut then there’s Tiger Woods.\nVideo Figure: World Golf Rankings over time.\nFrom the late 1990s through the late 2000s, Tiger didn’t just reach No. 1 — he lived there. Week after week, month after month, year after year, Tiger anchored himself at the top while waves of other great players crashed below.\nAt his peak, Tiger spent 683 weeks as the No. 1 ranked player in the world. That’s over 13 cumulative years — more than double the next closest golfer.\nEven when injuries or personal setbacks interrupted him, his dominance was so overwhelming that his “off years” would still be career high years for almost anyone else.\nAs former world No. 1 Lee Westwood put it,\n\n“It wasn’t a case of who was the best — it was who was the best behind Tiger.”\n\nTiger didn’t just win a peak. He built an era."

    "text": "5 Tiger at the Majors\nIf regular tournaments showed Tiger’s dominance, the majors showed his ability to rise highest on the biggest stages.\nTiger won 15 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus’ 18.\nHe completed the “Tiger Slam” — holding all four major titles simultaneously — something never done before in the modern era.\nHis margin of victory at the 2000 U.S. Open? 15 shots — the largest in major championship history.\nAt his best, majors weren’t just tournaments Tiger hoped to win — they were stages he commanded.\nThere’s a lineage of awe in golf that’s passed from one generation to the next. In 1965, after witnessing Jack Nicklaus’ dominant performance at the Masters, Bobby Jones remarked, “He plays a game with which I am not familiar.” Decades later, Nicklaus found himself on the other side of that sentiment. After playing alongside Tiger Woods, he echoed Jones’ words, acknowledging that Tiger had elevated the game to new heights.\n\n“He plays a game with which I am not familiar.”\n\nIn an era filled with talent, Tiger made majors feel like formalities."

    "text": "6 The Comeback: Masters 2019\nNo visualization can quite capture what happened at Augusta in 2019. But it remains one of sport’s greatest comeback stories.\nAfter multiple back surgeries, scandals, and years without a major win, Tiger’s career looked over. Even he admitted:\n\n“I had serious doubts after what transpired a couple years ago. I could barely walk. I couldn’t sit. I couldn’t lay down. I really couldn’t do much of anything.”\n\nBut then in a swirl of roars at Augusta National, he did it.\nIt was his first major win in 11 years.\nIt was his fifth Masters victory, bringing his major tally to 15.\nIt was the first time he had ever come from behind to win a major.\nAs Jim Nantz famously called it,\n\n“The return to glory.”\n\nIn that moment, Tiger wasn’t just a former champion. He was a living legend — redefining what perseverance and greatness looked like."

    "text": "7 Final Thoughts\nTiger Woods’ greatness isn’t just in the wins, or the money, or the records — although there are plenty of all three. It’s in the way he changed golf forever.\nHe forced everyone to raise their games. He made fitness, mental strength, and precision prerequisites, not bonuses. He turned golf into a global sport, transcending backgrounds and generations. And in the data — the relentless cut streaks, the top-5 rates, the No. 1 rankings, the earnings gaps — we see what our eyes always knew: he was doing something no one else could even dream of doing.\nIn an age obsessed with numbers, Tiger’s career delivers the rarest thing of all: numbers that don’t just impress — they awe.\nAs Rory McIlroy once put it:\n\n“If you grew up playing golf, you wanted to be Tiger Woods. You didn’t want to be anyone else.”\n\nAnd maybe that’s the ultimate measure. In every stat, in every chart, in every round played under pressure — Tiger Woods didn’t just dominate. He redefined greatness itself."
